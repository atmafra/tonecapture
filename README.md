# tonecapture
ToneCapture Studio intends to be a manager of Impulse Response files (for cabinet simulation and reverb) and other types of capture files, like NAM captures. The main objectives are:
- to store and manage these tone files with extra meta information about them (like the speaker and microphone used in an IR, or the amplifier for a NAM capture)
- to retrieve these files based on filters
- to be able to find and cluster those files by similarity (perhaps using embeddings)
